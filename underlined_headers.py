"""Commands for working with with setext-style (underlined) Markdown headers.

Header dashes can be completed with <tab>. For example:

	This is an H2
	-<tab>

Becomes:

	This is an H2
	-------------

Inspired by the similar TextMate command.

Also adds "Fix Underlined Markdown Headers" to Tools > Command Palette. After modifying
header text, this command will re-align the underline dashes with the new text length.

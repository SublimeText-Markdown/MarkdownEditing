  this definition aims to meet CommonMark specifications http://spec.commonmark.org/
  with GitHub Formatted Markdown extensions              https://github.github.com/gfm/
  and has a few extras like Markdown Extra's footnotes   https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/#footnotes
  the scope suffix should indicate which flavor of Markdown the feature came from, to help make this syntax definition easier to maintain

        We terminate the block quote when seeing an empty line, a
        separator or a line with leading > characters. The latter is
        to “reset” the quote level for quoted lines.
        The idea here is to match block level elements first, then once
        we have confirmed there are no block level elements left, move to
        matching inline markdown. This prevents block level elements being
        detected when they shouldn't be.
